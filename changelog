        Changelog Created 
        Readme Updated, select explained
        Tried implementing select, but actually really breaks the program
## [Version 0.1.0] (11-24-2022)
    Alf + Ionmi:
        Server now works with select, can take multiple connections with little to no problem, gotta test further
    Alf:
        Added a new entry on the README about select and fixed the File hierarchy
        Tidied up some things on the server class and methods so its less confusing
